## Goals
- Implement algorithms based on ergodic theory to improve simulation accuracy.
- Provide tools for analyzing simulation data to ensure it reflects the true statistical properties of the system.
- Create a user-friendly framework for running and configuring simulations.

## Features
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Tools for simulating the behavior of particles in various environments.
- **Statistical Mechanics Models**: Simulations of large particle ensembles to study macroscopic properties.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Functions for analyzing and validating simulation data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/csacan/ergodic-theory-simulations.git
cd ergodic-theory-simulations
pip install -r requirements.txt


To run a basic molecular dynamics simulation:
python run_simulation.py --config configs/molecular_dynamics.yaml

Use the provided analysis tools to validate and interpret your simulation data:
python analyze_results.py --input simulation_output.h5

### Initial File Structure
The initial structure should include directories for configuration files, core simulation code, and analysis tools.

This outline sets the foundation for the project, allowing for gradual deep dives into specific areas of ergodic theory,
molecular dynamics, and statistical mechanics as the project evolves. Future updates will include detailed algorithm implementations,
configuration options, and comprehensive analysis tools.
